Maximum and Mininum Number in a list
===============================================
You need to get the `min` and `max` number in a list.

Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and max number, respectively, as follows `[min, max]`

In cases where the min and max numbers are equal, return an array with just the number, as the first index `[number]`


***Here are some examples***

`[1, 2, 3]` should _return_      `[1, 3]`

`[1, 0, 8, 3]` should _return_   `[0, 8]`

`[-1, -55, -2]` should _return_  `[-55, -2]`

`[1, 1, 1]` should _return_      `[1]`
