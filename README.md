#Maximum and Mininum Number in a list

You need to get the `min` and `max` number in a list.

Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and max number, respectively, as follows `[min, max]`

In cases where the min and max numbers are equal, return an array with just the number, as the first index `[number]`


***Here are some examples***

`[1, 2, 3]` should _return_      `[1, 3]`

`[1, 0, 8, 3]` should _return_   `[0, 8]`

`[-1, -55, -2]` should _return_  `[-55, -2]`

`[1, 1, 1]` should _return_      `[1]`

##How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\max-min-number.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
